# webTool

This is a tool to prototype and develop web sites easily. At the begining it was developed for teaching purposes, nowadays it surpasses this function with a complete set of features. 

The project is server agnostic, despite it uses NodeJS as a web server. You can move the "tool" folder to any other kind of server.

There is an online (and slow to load) version where you can test this tool at:

[https://optimisme.github.io/webTool/public/tool/](https://optimisme.github.io/webTool/public/tool/)

Obviously, with the online version, all the paths and URLs must be from Internet.

Or with an observer:

```

When running, to use the tool, navigate to: 

[http://localhost:3002/tool](http://localhost:3002/tool)

Put your public files at "public" folder (like ".css", ".js" and images), and reference them with its base path from the tool. For example: 

```
"/file.png" is located at "./public/file.png"
```

Also, test the files generated by the tool, moving these files to the "public" folder.
